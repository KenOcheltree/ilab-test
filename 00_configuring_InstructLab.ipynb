        "# Summary\n",
        "This notebook set demonstrates InstructLab, an open source AI project that facilitates knowledge and skills contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs). InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large Language Models introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081). The open source InstructLab repository is available [here](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab) and provides additional documentation on using InstructLab.\n",
        "\n",
        "InstructLab  can be instantiated in several different forms, depending on the processing capabilities available. InstructLab can take the form of an open source installation or a Red Hat AI InstructLab installation. The open source installation can be run on a range of hardware from a laptop to a build your own (BYO) server instance running on a Virtual Machine (VM). The below figure shows the different available instantiations of InstructLab.\n",

        "* **Large-scale synthetic data generation:** A teacher model is used to generate new examples based on the seed training data. Recognizing that synthetic data can vary in quality, the InstructLab method adds an automated step to refine the example answers, ensuring they are grounded and safe.\n",
