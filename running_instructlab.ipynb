    "## Summary\n",
    "This notebook set demonstrates InstructLab, an open source AI project that facilitates knowledge and skills contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs). InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large Language Models introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081). The open source InstructLab repository is available [here](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab) and provides additional documentation on using InstructLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "InstructLab  can be instantiated in several different forms, depending on the processing capabilities available. InstructLab can take the form of an open source installation or a Red Hat AI InstructLab installation. The open source installation can be run on a range of hardware from a laptop to a build your own (BYO) server instance running on a Virtual Machine (VM). The below figure shows the different available instantiations of InstructLab.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates the configuration of InstructLab. The InstructLab method consists of three major components:\n",
    "* **Taxonomy-driven data curation:**  The taxonomy is a set of training data curated by humans as examples of new knowledge and skills for the model.\n",
    "* **Large-scale synthetic data generation:** A teacher model is used to generate new examples based on the seed training data. Recognizing that synthetic data can vary in quality, the InstructLab method adds an automated step to refine the example answers, ensuring they are grounded and safe.\n",

    "## Step 2.4. Generate Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This step will produce synthetic training data from the provided repository in the form of question and answer pairs. To generate synthetic data, InstructLab uses s large teacher model, such as Mixtral 8x7B, to create synthetic training data about the manually created data to train a small student model, such as the Merlinite 7B or Granite 7B models.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.4.1 Set data generation parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Select pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "InstructLab has three primary pipelines that can be used: simple, full and acellerated:\n",
    "- The **simple pipeline** runs fast and can be used for initial model and data testing. \n",
    "- The **full pipeline** runs all of the InstrctLab steps and takes more time but produces a better tuned model. \n",
    "- The **accelerated pipeline** runs the full pipeline processing using a GPU, so it produces a similarly tuned model in a shorter time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are running with a new or modifed dataset, you may want to use the **Simple pipeline** for the first run to verify the configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sepect number of samples to generate\n",
    "\n",
    "Data generation takes 19 minutes for generating 15 synthetic data samples. You may wish to generate a small number on your first run to verify the QNA dataset format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce **sufficient synthetic data** to focus training on the new material, **about 30 synthetic questions and answer pairs need to be generated** for each question and answer pair provided. This will require a proportionally longer time to generate, but will provide better training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before following these instructions, ensure the existing model you are adding skills or knowledge to is still running. Alternatively, ilab data generate can start a server for you if you provide a fully qualified model path via --model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a synthetic dataset based on your newly added knowledge or skill set in taxonomy repository, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ilab data generate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Simple Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Simple Pipeline works solely with Merlinite 7b Lab as the teacher model. The Simple Pipeline is called without GPU acceleration as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ilab data generate --pipeline simple\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Full Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Full Pipeline runs the full processing with a GPU. Currently, the Full Pipeline only supports the Mixtral and Mistral Instruct Family models as the teacher model.  This is due to only supporting specific model prompt templates.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.5.1 Select the model training pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "InstructLab has three primary model training pipelines: simple, full (default), and accelerated. For all of the models, the training time can be limited by adjusting the num_epoch paramater. The maximum number of epochs for running the InstructLab end-to-end workflow is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Simple pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple pipeline uses an SFT Trainer on Linux and MLX on MacOS. This type of training takes roughly an hour and produces the lowest fidelity model but should indicate if your data is being picked up by the training process. The simple pipeline only works with Merlinite 7b Lab as the teacher model. For this Linux system, the trained model is saved in the models directory as ggml-model-f16.gguf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command form is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ilab model train --pipeline simple\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This process will take a little while to complete (time can vary based on hardware and output of ilab data generate but on the order of 5 to 15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Full pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The full pipeline uses a custom training loop and data processing functions for the granite family of models. This loop is optimized for CPU and MPS functionality. Please use **--pipeline=full** in combination with **--device=cpu** for this Linus system. For a MacOS system you can use --device=mps (MacOS) or --device=cpu, however, MPS is optimized for better performance on MacOS systems. The full pipeline only works with Mixtral and Mistral Instruct Family models as the teacher model. For the full pipeline, the models are saved in the ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints directory. The instructlab command \"ilab model evaluate\" can be used to choose the best one.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Accelerated pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The accelerated uses the instructlab-training library which supports GPU accelerated and distributed training. The full loop and data processing functions are either pulled directly from or based off of the work in this library. For the accelerated pipeline, the models are saved in the ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints directory. The instructlab command \"ilab model evaluate\" can be used to choose the best one. Training is support for GPU acceleration with Nvidia CUDA or AMD ROCm. Please see the GPU acceleration documentation for more details. At present, hardware acceleration requires a data center GPU or high-end consumer GPU with at least 18 GB free memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command form is:\n",

    "    ilab model train --pipeline accelerated --device cuda --data-path <path-to-sdg-data>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Multiphase**\n",

    "When running multi phase training evaluation is run on each phase, we will tell you which checkpoint in this folder performs the best. Train the model locally with multi-phase training and GPU acceleration. This results in the following workflow:\n",

    "1. Evaluate the trained model to find the best checkpoint\n",
    "1. We train the model on skills\n",
