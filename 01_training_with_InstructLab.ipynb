    "This step will produce synthetic training data from the provided repository in the form of question and answer pairs. To generate synthetic data, InstructLab uses s large teacher model, such as Mixtral 8x7B, to create synthetic training data about the manually created data to train a small student model, such as the Merlinite 7B or Granite 7B models.\n",

    "- The **simple pipeline** runs fast and can be used for initial model and data testing. \n",
    "- The **full pipeline** runs all of the InstrctLab steps and takes more time but produces a better tuned model. \n",
    "- The **accelerated pipeline** runs the full pipeline processing using a GPU, so it produces a similarly tuned model in a shorter time.\n",

    "\n",
    "To produce **sufficient synthetic data** to focus training on the new material, **about 30 synthetic questions and answer pairs need to be generated** for each question and answer pair provided. This will require a proportionally longer time to generate, but will provide better training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before following these instructions, ensure the existing model you are adding skills or knowledge to is still running. Alternatively, ilab data generate can start a server for you if you provide a fully qualified model path via --model.\n",

    "### **Full Pipeline**\n",

This type of training takes roughly an hour and produces the lowest fidelity model but should indicate if your data is being picked up by the training process.
